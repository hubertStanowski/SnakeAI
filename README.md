# SnakeAI
Pure python implementation of NEAT algorithm for the snake game.

Starting with fully connected neural network (in my FlappyBirdAI project I just let NEAT mutate all connections by itself)

Project in progress, NEAT is fully functional, but still working on some UI elements.

Will add  a guide within a week

wait until 10th generation (or click on a button with the generation you want to see and wait till evolution reaches it) or press ENTER to see evolved snake
